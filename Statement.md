 Problem statement
Beginners and self-taught learners often lack a single, well-structured repository of small, practical programming examples, exercises, and tests that demonstrate core concepts across languages. This project addresses the need for an organized, easy-to-run collection of beginner-friendly code samples, exercises with solutions, and automated checks to accelerate learning and reduce setup friction.

 Scope of the project
- Curate and maintain a repository of small, focused programming examples and exercises.
- Provide runnable examples with clear instructions, sample inputs/outputs, and unit tests.
- Include solutions and explanations for each exercise.
- Support one or more programming languages commonly taught to beginners (e.g., Python, JavaScript).
- Add CI configuration to run tests automatically and scripts to run examples locally.
- Provide basic documentation and templates for adding new exercises.

 Target users
- Beginner programmers learning fundamentals (variables, control flow, data structures, I/O).
- Self-learners and hobbyists who want runnable examples and exercises.
- Instructors and mentors looking for a curated set of classroom or homework exercises.
- Developers onboarding to basic patterns who prefer short, isolated examples.

 High-level features
- Repository structure with per-language directories and naming conventions.
- README with setup and contribution guidelines.
- Exercise files with:
  - Problem description
  - Starter code
  - Reference solution
  - Unit tests and expected outputs
- Automated test suite (local scripts + CI pipeline) to validate exercises.
- Clear documentation for running examples and adding new exercises.
- Minimal tooling scripts to create new exercise templates and run tests.
- Licensing and contribution guidelines to encourage reuse and collaboration.
